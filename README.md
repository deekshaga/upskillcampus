My project is about smart water meter
 Increasing water consumption and wastage are leading to water scarcity. While a large population has no safe drinking water, some people use a lot of water daily and waste it. Develop a project related to the Smart Water meter System which can be used to calculate the flow rate and quantity of water consumed by the householders and send it to the cloud to monitor the consumption of water.
